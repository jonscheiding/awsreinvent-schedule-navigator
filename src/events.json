  "abstract": "Come learn how OrangeX in Spain is transforming enterprise networks with AWS Cloud and Nokia's Nuage SD-WAN. Nuage's SD-WAN is delivered with management, control, and user plane in the AWS cloud. It is powered by Amazon EC2 i3.metal and AWS hybrid IT services via true multi-tenant, built-in multi-segment orchestrators, and multi-tier management spanning from operators to partners to direct enterprise portals. This enables the solution to be extended directly to service provider private backbones and cloud data centers and services, as well as between enterprise sites. The solution further enables SD-WAN over last mile broadband and leased wholesale circuits to access existing private backbones to leverage their reliable mid-mile connectivity and existing connectivity to enterprise sites. With SD-WAN becoming an essential function in vCPE deployments, Nuage’s SD-WAN has been established as the platform for simplifying the delivery and deployment of virtual network functions, such as security and agility, on-premises, and in the cloud. Learn factors to consider in using SD-WAN solution with AWS, agile implementation of the solution, and leveraging a cloud-ready operating model. We share sufficient references for you to take away to continue learning.",

It applies to a diverse number of use cases, from web applications and APIs to data processing applications. Although serverless computing and AWS Lambda have changed how application development is done, the Twelve-Factor best practices remain relevant and applicable in a serverless world. You'll learn how to directly apply the Twelve-Factor methodology to serverless application development with Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. As you’ll see, many of these factors are not only directly applicable to serverless applications, but in fact a default mechanism or capability of the AWS serverless platform. ",

Even in the cloud, you have to ensure continuity. Traditional disaster recovery (DR) solutions are not optimized for the cloud and often result in higher costs, increased complexity, and operational challenges. To maintain compliance and business continuity service-level agreements, AWS DR planning requires a completely different approach to deal with cross-account, cross-region workload testing and failover. In this session, learn how you can set up an effective DR plan for your AWS environments. This session is brought to you by AWS partner, Druva.",

  "abstract": "Application modernization projects with AWS often start with creating a hybrid cloud landing zone to ensure a secure, performant, highly available, and cost-efficient AWS environment. Common hybrid cloud use cases, such as cloud migration, data center extension, disaster recovery, and cloud bursting require data integration, resources and deployment management integration, security and identity integration, and devices and edge systems integration as the foundational components of a hybrid cloud landing zone. In this session, we dive deep on the networking, security, account management structure, operating model, and management configuration best practices to build your own hybrid cloud landing zone. There is 80% commonality across all these hybrid cloud uses cases, but 20% of them are unique. We dive deep on the nuances for each of these use cases to provide different hybrid cloud landing zone lenses on top of the core hybrid cloud landing zone.",

In this session, an AWS expert walks through the ten commandments that enterprises should follow when moving applications to the cloud and refactoring them for optimal performance. Then, a representative of Sysco Corporation, a Fortune 50 company, shares how the company migrated mission-critical legacy business systems and modernized them to take advantage of the AWS Cloud. Learn how the company moved its enterprise purchasing system, which processes millions of dollars in sales daily, to the AWS Cloud while achieving a 60% decrease in run costs.

IaC provides an automated way to quickly and reliably deploy the compute, storage, network, and specialized services required by your applications, and it eliminates the costly and error-prone process of manually installing and configuring infrastructure every time your application changes. In this session, learn about tools and best practices in defining your IaC. We show you how to define and deploy cloud infrastructure using modern programming languages such as TypeScript, Java, .NET, Ruby, and Python. We walk you through the process of defining your infrastructure with code and then testing and deploying it. Finally, we demonstrate how to use existing IDE functionality, such as refactoring tools, code navigation, and unit testing, to ensure it all works as expected.",

With the introduction of AWS AppSync, we can easily extend the possibilities of what GraphL is capable of, enabling a single GraphQL API to power entire applications by working with multiple data sources, microservices, and AWS Lambda functions. In this session, we show this architecture in action, walk through the design and implementation, and answer your questions as we dive deep.",

As you’ll see, many of these factors are not only directly applicable to serverless applications, but in fact a default mechanism or capability of the AWS serverless platform. ",

  "abbreviation": "ARC327-R1",
  "abstract": "SaaS presents developers with a unique blend of architectural challenges. Supporting a multi-tenant model often means re-thinking your approach to almost every layer of your architecture. Onboarding, security, data partitioning, tenant isolation, identity—these are areas that must be factored into how you design, build, and deploy your SaaS solution. Of course, the best way to wrap your mind around these SaaS architectural principles is to dig into a working example. In this workshop, we’ll expose you to the core concepts of SaaS architecture then dive into a reference SaaS architecture where you can see the moving parts of a SaaS solution in action. The goal here is to provide a series of activities that allow you to interact with a functional solution, introducing code and configuration that realizes and extends the capabilities of this SaaS environment. Through this combination of a brief lecture and hands-on exercises, you’ll get a healthy dose of SaaS best practices all through the lens of a working reference solution. ",

Attendees will also create a custom project for AWS DeepLens that detects birds and triggers species identification. By the end of the workshop, you will have a working end-to-end solution. Prerequisites: hands-on experience with Python, AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, and Amazon S3 are required to get the most value from the workshop. Attendees are expected to be comfortable with the basics of SageMaker, but prior DeepLens experience is not required. Attendees must bring their own laptop.",

Participants learn to secure serverless applications using Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, Amazon Macie, AWS Secrets Manager, Amazon Cognito, AWS IAM, AWS KMS, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and DevSecOps. Walk away with an understanding of the options and best practices for securing serverless workloads and adopting secure DevOps practices.",

  "abstract": "Most organizations today run their production workloads inside Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). This software-defined network structure provides the boundaries that are needed for the security that an organization and its customers require. For most organizations, the natural evolution in their architecture, security, and environment involves migrating from a single VPC to multiple VPCs in the same AWS Region and across many other AWS Regions. The question of how to enforce security policies while simplifying the flow of traffic between multiple VPCs, the data center, and remote offices while adhering to AWS best practices becomes an intricate one to answer. In this chalk talk, we provide solutions to scenarios like these and more. Topics include Amazon security groups, NACLs, static and dynamic VPNs, AWS Direct Connect, IPS and IDS, transit VPC architectures, designing for security, and more.",
